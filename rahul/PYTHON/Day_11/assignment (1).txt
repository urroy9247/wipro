NoSQL databases come in various types, each designed to handle different use cases, scalability needs, and data models. Here are four prominent NoSQL databases and their differences:

1. MongoDB
Type: Document-oriented
Data Model: Stores data in BSON (Binary JSON) format, which allows for nested structures.
Use Cases: Suitable for applications needing flexible schema, such as content management systems, catalogs, and analytics.
Scalability: Horizontal scaling with sharding, and it’s very good at handling high-traffic and large datasets.
Query Language: MongoDB uses a rich query language similar to SQL, but queries are expressed in JSON-like syntax. It also supports aggregation pipelines.
Consistency Model: Offers eventual consistency by default, with the ability to configure for strong consistency if necessary.

2. Cassandra
Type: Wide-column store
Data Model: Data is stored in tables, but each row does not need to have the same columns. This flexibility is ideal for time-series data and IoT applications.
Use Cases: Excellent for write-heavy applications and scenarios requiring high availability, such as logging systems and sensor networks.
Scalability: Extremely scalable horizontally across many nodes, and it’s designed for high availability and fault tolerance, making it suitable for distributed systems.
Query Language: Cassandra uses CQL (Cassandra Query Language), which is similar to SQL but tailored to its wide-column data model.
Consistency Model: Cassandra provides tunable consistency, allowing users to choose between strong consistency or eventual consistency, based on use case needs.

3. Redis
Type: Key-Value store
Data Model: Stores data in key-value pairs. Redis is known for its in-memory storage, which makes it extremely fast for data retrieval.
Use Cases: Commonly used for caching, session storage, real-time analytics, and leaderboards. Its in-memory nature makes it ideal for use cases requiring low latency.
Scalability: It supports both horizontal and vertical scaling, though its primary use case focuses on high-performance, low-latency applications.
Query Language: Redis provides a simple set of commands for interacting with data, including commands for strings, lists, sets, and hashes.
Consistency Model: Redis provides eventual consistency but can be configured for persistence in case of restarts.

4. Neo4j
Type: Graph database
Data Model: Neo4j is optimized for storing data as graphs (nodes, relationships, and properties). It’s excellent for applications where relationships between data points are crucial.
Use Cases: Ideal for social networks, fraud detection, recommendation engines, and network analysis, where relationships and connections are central.
Scalability: Neo4j focuses on single-node scalability but can support clustering and sharding to some extent.
Query Language: Neo4j uses Cypher, a declarative graph query language that makes it easy to query graph data by focusing on relationships.
Consistency Model: It offers ACID compliance, ensuring strong consistency for transactional operations.

Key Differences:

Data Models: MongoDB uses a document model, Cassandra uses wide-column, Redis uses key-value, and Neo4j uses a graph model.

Use Cases: MongoDB is flexible and good for general-purpose applications, Cassandra excels at handling large-scale distributed systems, Redis is designed for high-performance real-time use cases, and Neo4j is perfect for complex relationship-based queries.

Scalability: Cassandra and MongoDB are highly scalable horizontally, while Redis is more focused on performance and can be scaled but in a more specific use-case manner. Neo4j can scale but is better suited for complex graph traversal rather than massive data volumes.

Consistency: Cassandra offers tunable consistency, MongoDB provides eventual consistency (though configurable for stronger consistency), Redis focuses on performance and offers eventual consistency, and Neo4j maintains ACID compliance for consistency.
