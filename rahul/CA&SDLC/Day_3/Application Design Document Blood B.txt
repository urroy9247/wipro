Application Design Document: Blood Bank Management System (BBMS)
1. Introduction
This document provides an in-depth description of the design and architecture for the Blood Bank Management System (BBMS). The system is designed to optimize the processes of blood donation management, patient blood requests, and donor information tracking in a secure and efficient manner.
1.1 Purpose
The BBMS aims to streamline and automate the core functionalities involved in managing blood donations, inventory, and patient blood requests. It provides an interface for administrators, patients, and donors to interact with the system efficiently while ensuring data security and system scalability.
1.2 Scope
•	Blood Donation Management: The system will track donated blood, monitor its availability, and manage expiration dates.
•	Patient Blood Requests: The system will enable patients to submit blood requests, view the status of their requests, and check blood availability.
•	Donor Registration and History: Donors can register, schedule donations, and track their donation history.
1.3 Target Audience
•	Admin: The staff responsible for managing the blood bank's operations, including inventory, donation, and user management.
•	Patients: Individuals requiring blood transfusions who will use the platform to request blood and check on availability.
•	Donors: Individuals who wish to donate blood, view upcoming donation events, and manage their donation history.

2. Application Overview
2.1 Purpose
The Blood Bank Management System (BBMS) is intended to:
•	Simplify donation management: Through better scheduling, real-time inventory tracking, and blood request handling.
•	Ensure accuracy and efficiency: By automating processes such as inventory updates, donor management, and patient request handling.
•	Enhance user experience: By providing intuitive interfaces for all users—admin, patients, and donors.
2.2 Functional Overview
•	Admin Interface: Manages inventory, donor and patient profiles, and overall system configuration.
•	Patient Interface: Allows patients to request blood, view inventory, and check the status of their requests.
•	Donor Interface: Allows donors to schedule donation appointments, view donation history, and track upcoming donation events.

3. System Architecture
The application is designed using a multi-tier architecture consisting of three main layers:
3.1 Presentation Layer
•	Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS or Angular.
•	Role-Specific Interfaces: 
o	Admin Interface: Provides an overview of blood inventory, donation requests, and system management tools.
o	Patient Interface: Displays available blood types, patient-specific request forms, and request statuses.
o	Donor Interface: Lists upcoming donation events, allows donors to manage profiles, and tracks donation history.
3.2 Business Logic Layer
•	Technologies: Node.js (with Express) or Java (Spring Boot).
•	Core Modules: 
o	User Management: Authentication (sign-up, login, password management), role-based access control (admin, donor, patient).
o	Blood Inventory: Manages different blood types, quantities, and expiration dates.
o	Donation Management: Tracks donor schedules, profiles, and donation history.
o	Request Management: Handles patient blood requests, processes approval/rejection, and updates request statuses.
3.3 Data Access Layer
•	Technologies: MySQL or PostgreSQL as relational databases.
•	ORM: Sequelize (Node.js) or Hibernate (Java).
•	Database Models: 
o	Users: Donor, Patient, and Admin profiles.
o	Blood Inventory: Records for blood type, quantity, expiry date, etc.
o	Requests: Patient blood requests, statuses, and history.

6. Non-Functional Requirements
6.1 Performance
•	The system should handle 10,000 concurrent users without performance degradation.
•	Response times should remain under 2 seconds for all user interactions.
6.2 Security
•	User Data Encryption: All sensitive user data, including personal and medical information, should be encrypted.
•	API Security: Secure RESTful APIs with token-based authentication (JWT) and role-based access control.
•	Admin Access: Multi-factor authentication (MFA) for admins to prevent unauthorized access.
6.3 Scalability
•	The system should be scalable to support increased load, particularly during high-demand periods (e.g., disaster response or public health emergencies).
•	Horizontal scaling should be possible, with the option to deploy in cloud environments like AWS or Azure.
6.4 Usability
•	The application should be intuitive and easy to navigate, even for users with limited technical knowledge.
•	Mobile responsiveness is required to ensure that users can access the system on smartphones and tablets.

8. Testing and Validation
8.1 Unit Testing
•	Test each module independently to ensure that it functions correctly in isolation.
8.2 Integration Testing
•	Ensure that all modules interact correctly with one another. For example, ensure that the Donation Management Module correctly updates the Blood Inventory.
8.3 User Acceptance Testing
•	Real users, including admins, donors, and patients, will test the system in a production-like environment to validate that it meets their needs and expectations.
