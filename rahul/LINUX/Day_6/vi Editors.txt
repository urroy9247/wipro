----------
1)Command mode: With in the command mode, signals from the keyboard are interpreted as editing commands.

2) Insert mode: It can be entered by typing any of the vi insert, append, open , substitute, change or replace commands. Here the letters typed at the keyboard are inserted in to the editing buffer.Once we save then the text from the buffer will be replaced in the editor.

3) Escape mode: To use the escape mode type colon(:). The colon is echoed on the status line as a prompt for the commands.
